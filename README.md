# Music Visualizer Product Plan

## Initial Product Requirements
- Allow users to load or stream audio files (MP3, WAV) directly in the browser.
- Provide real-time visual feedback synchronized with audio playback.
- Offer playback controls (play, pause, seek) alongside visualization controls.
- Support responsive layout that adapts to desktop and tablet viewports.
- Enable users to toggle between different visualization modes as the product evolves.

## Target Platforms & Technology Stack
- **Platforms:** Web-first experience optimized for desktop and tablet browsers.
- **Core Libraries & APIs:**
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast local development and build tooling.
  - [React](https://react.dev/) for component-driven UI structure.
  - Native **Web Audio API** to analyze audio data in real time.
  - HTML5 `<canvas>` for drawing performant visualizations.

## First Visualization Concept
Start with a simple animated **bar spectrum analyzer**:
- Split the audio frequency data into ~32 bars using the Web Audio API's frequency data array.
- Each bar's height corresponds to the amplitude of its frequency bin, easing up/down for smooth motion.
- Apply subtle gradient fills and drop shadows for depth, with low-frequency bars wider for visual weight.
- Include a baseline waveform glow beneath the bars to hint at future hybrid visualizations.
