# Demo audio storage

Store lightweight demo-friendly audio assets in this folder when you want to ship them with the repository. For larger collections use the `DEMO_AUDIO_BASE_URL` environment variable to point the app at a remote storage bucket (Vercel Blob, AWS S3, etc.).

Files in this directory are automatically copied into the Vercel deployment output during the build step.
